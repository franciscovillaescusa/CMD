**May 2024:** We have identified a small bug in the code used to create the 2D images. This bug will have negligible consequences for most applications and only affects the pixels in the boundaries of the images. We have fixed the bug and redone all the images. The old images are still accessible for reference.

**July 2023:** We have created a game to test the abilities of users to perform visual classification and regression using CMD images. Check :ref:`game` for details.

**July 2023:** CMD now contains 2D maps and 3D grids from the CV, 1P, and EX simulation sets of CAMELS. This data can be useful for testing a variety of models.

**June 2023:** Hundreds of thousands of 2D maps and 3D grids created from the CAMELS-Astrid simulations have been added to CMD. Now CMD contains maps and grids from three different hydrodynamic codes. Check :ref:`data` for details.
